This bundle of trouble is George, Curious George. The friend of the Man in the Yellow Hat causes many difficulties and has many attributes.
These traits include:
- Overly Curious (as implied by his name)
- Recklessness
- Extremely Creative
- Caring
- Generous

This little monkey was first spotted on the 4th of September 2006 where he was seen flying a kite with his human friend.
Since then, George and the Man in the Yellow Hat have been seen together out and about doing all sorts of weird and wonderful things.
George and his yellow-hatted friend have since embarked on adventures where they have found the lost treasure of Bugaboo End, took part in the great golden egg hunt and also done the simpler thing - like making a pizza.
