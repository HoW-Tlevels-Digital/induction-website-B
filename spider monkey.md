This little monkey is very cheeky, it can climb to high places and run into small places with its very small body.

Spider Monkeys are New World monkeys belonging to the genus Ateles, part of the subfamily Atelinae.

Disproportionately long limbs and long prehensile tails make them one of the largest New World monkeys and give rise to their common name. Spider monkeys live in the upper layers of the rainforest, and forage in the high canopy, from 25 to 30 m (82 to 98 ft).

They primarily eat fruits, but will also occasionally consume leaves, flowers, and insects. Due to their large size, spider monkeys require large tracts of moist green evergreen forests.
